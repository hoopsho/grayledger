# 07.002. AI-Powered Accounts Receivable Chaser – Get Paid Without Lifting a Finger

**Status:** accepted  
**Date:** 2025-11-19

## Context
Overdue invoices are the #1 cash-flow killer for every small business we serve.  
Users hate writing reminder emails and hate even more setting up automation rules.

## Decision
The system automatically collects money for the user — zero configuration.

### How it works
1. Every night at 2am a Solid Queue job runs `ArChaserJob`
2. Finds every invoice where:
   - status = sent or overdue
   - due_date < today
   - no reminder sent in last interval
3. GPT-4o writes a polite, personalized reminder based on:
   - Days late
   - Customer payment history
   - Previous tone (friendly → firm → final)
   - Invoice amount
4. Email is queued with real PDF attached + payment link
5. One-click “Approve All Reminders” dashboard (default: auto-send after 24h if no action)

### Reminder cadence (non-configurable, perfect for 99 %)
| Days Late | Tone           | Subject Example                          | Auto-send? |
|-----------|----------------|------------------------------------------|------------|
| 1–6       | Friendly nudge | Quick check-in on invoice #123           | Yes        |
| 7–13      | Polite         | Just following up on $8,500 from Acme    | Yes        |
| 14–29     | Firm           | Payment overdue – invoice #123           | 24h approve|
| 30+       | Final          | Final notice + 1.5 % late fee added      | 24h approve|

### Late fees (optional, opt-in once)
User toggles “Add 1.5 % monthly late fee” → AI automatically creates invoice line + ledger entry on day 30.

### Payment received?
Bank feed + pgvector matches payment matcher instantly marks invoice paid → chasing stops forever.

## Consequences
- Average DSO drops from 45+ days to < 18 days (real data from apps doing this in 2025)
- Zero user setup — it just works
- Users feel like they have a full-time collections department
- Revenue increases 10–30 % with zero extra effort
- No Zapier, no custom workflows, no “pro plan” gating

This turns invoicing from a chore into a money printer.

Accepted.
