# 13.001. 1099 Tracking + One-Click Tax Package Export – Fire Your Accountant

**Status:** accepted  
**Date:** 2025-11-19

## Context
Every user’s endgame is:
- Pay contractors correctly
- File 1099-NEC on time (Jan 31)
- Hand the IRS/TurboTax perfect numbers with zero CPA bill

## Decision
We do it all in-app, one click, zero extra cost.

### 1099-NEC
1. When user adds a payment to a contractor > $600/year:
   - AI asks once “Is this a 1099 contractor?” (defaults yes for Contract Labor account)
   - Stores name, EIN/SSN, address
2. January 15 → “1099s ready” banner
3. One-click “File 1099s” → we use Tax1099.com API ($0.80/form, we eat it)
   - IRS e-file + recipient copies mailed
   - User never leaves our app

### One-Click Tax Package Export (Feb 1)
User clicks “Download 2025 Tax Package” → gets a ZIP with:

| File                     | Contents                                      | Imports Directly Into          |
|--------------------------|-----------------------------------------------|--------------------------------|

| form_4562.csv            | Full depreciation schedule                    | TurboTax                       |
| balance_sheet.csv        | Schedule L                                    | All                            |
| trial_balance.pdf        | Full general ledger                           | CPA backup                     |

| profit_loss.pdf          | Clean P&L with sub-account rollups            | Banker / loan applications     |

All numbers come straight from the 30 parent accounts → always matches what the IRS sees.

### No extra work
- No Chart of Accounts mapping
- No "export to CSV then import into TurboTax" dance
- No $3,000 CPA "tax prep" fee for simple businesses

## Consequences

- Users literally cancel their accountant the day they download this ZIP
- We become the most profitable $99/mo they spend all year
- Zero liability on us (numbers come from their books, we just format them)

This is the "holy shit" moment that turns users into lifelong evangelists.
