# 12.001. No User-Facing Third-Party Middleware – Ever

**Status:** accepted  
**Date:** 2025-11-19

## Context
The entire reason users will pay us $99/mo is because they are sick of:
- Logging into Plaid, A2X, Expensify, TaxJar, Gusto, etc.
- Paying five different SaaS tools
- Reconciling mismatches between systems

We promised “AI just does it all” — not “AI plus six other logins”.

## Decision
Zero third-party services that the user ever sees, touches, or signs up for.

Allowed (because they are invisible to the user):
- Plaid (we own the connection)
- TaxCloud (server-side only)
- OpenAI / Anthropic (invisible)
- AWS S3 (invisible)
- Stripe / PayPal webhooks (invisible)

Forbidden forever:
- Forcing user to create an A2X / LinkMyBooks / Webgility account
- Requiring Expensify / Dext / Hubdoc for receipts
- Sending user to TaxJar / Anrok dashboard
- Making user connect Zapier / Make.com
- Any “powered by X” badge that requires a separate login

If we can’t make it work with file upload → GPT-4o Vision / server-side API → ledger, we don’t do it at launch.

## Consequences
- Users stay inside our app 100 % of the time
- Onboarding = connect bank once + upload anything weird → done
- Support load drops 90 % (no “why isn’t my A2X connected?” tickets)
- We eat tiny per-transaction costs ($0.01–$0.05) because volume makes it free
- The product actually feels like magic instead of QuickBooks with extra steps

This is the religious commitment that wins the market.

Accepted.
