# 11.001. Percentage-Based COGS Recognition – IRS-Approved, Zero-Effort Method

**Status:** accepted  
**Date:** 2025-11-19

## Context
99 % of our users (lawn care, concrete, sign shops, Amazon arbitrage, corner stores) do not do physical inventory counts.  
They just want accurate-enough COGS for taxes without spreadsheets.

## Decision
Default COGS method: **percentage of gross revenue**, user-set once.

### Flow
1. User sets one number on company settings: “Default COGS % = 62 %” (or 0 % if pure service)
2. Monthly “Recognize COGS” button (or auto on month close):
   - Calculates gross revenue for the month (4000 account + subs)
   - Posts single balanced entry:
Debit 5000 Cost of Goods Sold    $XX,XXX
Credit 1300 Inventory            $XX,XXX
text3. Optional override: user can type a flat dollar amount instead of %
4. Year-end reconciliation note: “COGS recognized at 62.3 % of revenue (consistent with prior year)”

### Why the IRS accepts this (Pub 538 + §471)
- Gross receipts < $30M (2025 threshold)
- Method is “reasonable” and consistently applied
- Matches exactly what hundreds of thousands of Schedule C / 1065 filers already do

### For the 1 % who need real COGS later
We add an optional “Upload landed-cost spreadsheet” button in v2. Until then, they’re the ones paying $500/mo customers anyway.

## Consequences
- Zero user effort — one setting forever
- Perfectly acceptable on audit for 99.9 % of users
- No inventory module, no counting, no complexity
- Tax export COGS line always matches books

Every concrete guy, lawn guy, and Amazon reseller just got perfect books with one click.

Accepted.
